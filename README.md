# Candidate Assessment for the Front End role at toucanBox

We’re keen to see how you think, get a feel for your process and give you an opportunity to showcase your skills. To this end, we’ve prepared a brief for a potential real-world design project at toucanBox.

---

### Brief

Customers can log in to their accounts to do things like updating billing information, pausing their subscription etc. 

One feature is a page that lists a history of the craft boxes a customer has received. Customers are then asked to rate the boxes provided. 

Our UX designer has created a sample design, which uses our existing CSS styles:
![Desktop Screenshot](/rate_your_boxes_desktop.png?raw=true "Desktop Screenshot")

#### What we would like you to do
- Analyse the existing page, tell us what you think
- Implement a prototype in HTML/CSS/JS
- Record the steps of your process and be prepared to discuss what you did along the way

#### What we’re looking for
- Demonstration of HTML/CSS/JS skills
- Understanding of existing project code and ability to build on it
- A systematic approach to design challenges

---

In order to facilitate you building a prototype of your solution, we’ve created this Github repo.


#### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have the following:
- Ruby and the Bundler gem installed
- Git installed


#### Setting up local development
- Fork the front-end-developer repo and clone it locally
- Navigate to the repo’s directory

##### Tips
We suggest you use our base stylesheet and add or override your changes, otherwise everything is completely up to you. We're curious to see how you structure your work.
