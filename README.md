# Candidate Assessment for the UX Product Designer role at toucanBox

We’re keen to see how you think, get a feel for your process and give you an opportunity to showcase your skills. To this end, we’ve prepared a brief for a potential real-world design project at toucanBox.

---

### Brief

Customers can login to their accounts to do things like updating billing information, pausing their subscription etc. 

One feature is a page that lists a history of the craft boxes a customer has received. Right now it’s a bit utilitarian, but we think it might be a tremendous opportunity to delight our customers. 

Our customers are parents of children aged 3-8, and the children themselves of course! We happen to know that over 70% of our customers access our website on mobile.

An example of two of our business objectives are:
- Learn more about what our customers like/dislike about our craft boxes
- Find ways to extend the fun and increase the value of being a toucanBox subscriber

#### What we would like you to do
- Analyse the existing page, tell us what you think
- Quickly sketch some possibilities (user journey, wireframes)
- Home in on a possible solution and detail the design
- Implement a prototype of that solution in HTML/CSS/JS
- Record the steps of your process and be prepared to discuss what you did along the way

#### What we’re looking for
- ‘Product Thinking’ taking into consideration our customer’s needs, the business objectives and user centred design principles
- A systematic approach to design challenges
- Demonstration of HTML/CSS/JS skills

---

In order to facilitate you building a prototype of your solution, we’ve created this Github repo.


#### Prerequisites
This guide assumes you have the following:
- Ruby and the Bundler gem installed
- Git installed


#### Setting up local development
- Fork the product-designer repo and clone it locally
- Navigate to the repo’s directory
- Run the `bundle install` command to download and resolve the rack dependency.
- To run your site locally and view any modifications run `rackup` .

##### Tips
We suggest you use our base stylesheet and add or override your changes, otherwise everything is completely up to you. We're curious to see how you structure your work.
